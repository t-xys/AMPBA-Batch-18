Let us start with the basic Rock Paper Scissors AI project. Best way to tackle github is to learn some basics. I have added a couple of helpful resources here to get everyone started.

Github 101 video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=RGOj5yH7evk

For those who prefer a step by step blog: https://product.hubspot.com/blog/git-and-github-tutorial-for-beginners

Coursera has a nice course on using git (by google) for those interested: https://www.coursera.org/learn/introduction-git-github

For those who want to read a text book, proGit is the way to go: https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2

Let us Learn, Explore and Help each other. Cheers!
